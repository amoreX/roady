# Roady

Roady is a web application that helps users create personalized learning roadmaps. Users can input a topic they want to learn, and the app will generate a step-by-step timetable. The generated roadmap can be visualized as a tree structure, allowing users to track their progress interactively.

## Features

- **Topic Input**: Users can enter the topic they want to learn.
- **Roadmap Generation**: Automatically generate a step-by-step roadmap for the topic.
- **Editable Topics**: Users can delete or modify topics before finalizing the roadmap.
- **Tree Visualization**: Visualize the roadmap as a tree with branches, where each branch represents a topic or subtopic.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can tick off completed topics to track their progress.

## How It Works

1. Enter a topic you want to learn.
2. Click the "Roadmap It" button to generate a roadmap.
3. Edit or delete topics as needed.
4. Refresh the roadmap to finalize it.
5. Visualize the roadmap as a tree structure.
6. Track your progress by marking topics as completed.

## Example

The roadmap tree will look like this:

```
Root Topic
├── Subtopic 1
│   ├── Sub-subtopic 1.1
│   └── Sub-subtopic 1.2
├── Subtopic 2
└── Subtopic 3
```
